Another version of my modification for photon that lets you have multiple CCU by using a trick to use a different appID if the one before it is full!

# Tutorial on how to use
1. Copy and paste the playfabauthenticator code from the git (Remember to save your original appid, voice id and TitleID!)
2. After pasting and saving, you will see this
<img width="503" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ecfa81-142c-44ff-a2ff-fa07e8ffebc4" />

Your gonna put your original Appid inside of the MainAppID for token
Afterwards you will just keep on adding app id's and voice id's in the struct. The more structs you have, the more max players you will have!

The connection status text is optional, but may help with seeing if your attempting to connect, or connected.
